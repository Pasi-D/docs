Prisma is an [open source](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) next-generation ORM. It consists of the following parts:

- **Prisma Client**: Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript
- **Prisma Migrate**: Migration system
- **Prisma Studio**: GUI to view and edit data in your database

To get up and running quickly head over to our [Quickstart guide](./quickstart)

To get started, choose one of our [getting started tutorials](setup-prisma), explore [real-world projects that use Prisma](../about/example-projects), or check out our simpler, [ready-to-run examples on GitHub](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples). 

Otherwise, checkout our [Why Prisma](../concepts/overview/why-prisma) section which helps to explain what problems Prisma helps to solve, and why it's built to make you more productive.
