Welcome to the Prisma getting started section! ðŸ‘‹ Prisma is an [open source](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) next-generation ORM. It consists of the following parts:

- **Prisma Client**: Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript
- **Prisma Migrate**: Migration system
- **Prisma Studio**: GUI to view and edit data in your database

For a more detailed breakdown of what problems Prisma solves, and why it's **built to make you more productive**, see the [Why Prisma](../concepts/overview/why-prisma) section.

## Which tutorial is right for me?

The **easiest** way to get up and running with Prisma is through our [Quickstart guide](./quickstart). It makes no assumptions about your knowledge level and offers the **fastest** way from install to query!

If you're looking to incorporate Prisma with an **existing project**, then the aptly named [Add to existing project](./setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project-typescript-postgres) guide will show you how.

To learn how to **create a project** with Prisma from scratch, the [Start from scratch](./setup-prisma/start-from-scratch) section guides you through creating a project, connecting your database and querying your data.
