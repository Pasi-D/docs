<TopBlock>

Let's get you up and running as quickly as possible! Through the following guide you will:

1. Download a TypeScript starter project containing Prisma and an SQLite database file.
2. Install your dependencies.
3. Query some data and view the results.

> **Note**: You need [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 10 or higher) for this tutorial.

</TopBlock>

## Download the starter project

Open your terminal and use the following command to download the starter project.

<TabbedContent tabs={[<FileWithIcon text="Unix (Mac OS, Linux)" icon="display"/>, <FileWithIcon text="Windows" icon="display"/>]}>

<tab>

```terminal copy
curl -L https://pris.ly/quickstart | tar -xz --strip=2 quickstart-master/typescript/starter
```

</tab>

<tab>

```terminal copy
curl https://pris.ly/quickstart -L -o quickstart-master.tar.gz && tar -zxvf quickstart-master.tar.gz quickstart-master/typescript/starter && move quickstart-master\typescript\starter starter && rmdir /S /Q quickstart-master && del /Q quickstart-master.tar.gz
```

</tab>

</TabbedContent>

## Install the dependencies

From the same terminal move into the project and install the dependencies:

```terminal copy
cd starter
npm install
```

## Write some queries and view the results

The following query will read all the `User` records from the database and return all the users and their related posts.

One of the main features of Prisma Client is the ease of working with relations. You can retrieve the `posts` of each user by using the [`include`](../concepts/components/prisma-client/select-fields#include-relations-and-select-relation-fields) option.

Add the highlighted code to the main function in the `script.ts` file.

```ts file=script.ts highlight=7,8,9,10,11;add
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// A `main` function so that you can use async/await
async function main() {
  const allUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
    include: { posts: true },
  })
  // use `console.dir` to print nested objects
  console.dir(allUsers, { depth: null })
}

main()
  .catch(e => {
    throw e
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
```

Now run the code with the following command to see the output:

<CodeWithResult expanded={false}>

<cmd>

```terminal copy
npm run dev
```

</cmd>

<cmdResult>

```js no-lines
[
  { id: 1, email: 'sarah@prisma.io', name: 'Sarah', posts: [] },
  {
    id: 2,
    email: 'maria@prisma.io',
    name: 'Maria',
    posts: [
      {
        id: 1,
        title: 'Hello World',
        content: null,
        published: false,
        authorId: 2,
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

</cmdResult>

</CodeWithResult>

<Tip>

Also note that `allUsers` is _statically typed_ thanks to [Prisma Client's generated types](../concepts/components/prisma-client/advanced-type-safety/operating-against-partial-structures-of-model-types). You can observe the type by hovering over the `allUsers` variable in your editor.

</Tip>

Congratulations, you just wrote your first query with Prisma Client and returned some data! ðŸŽ‰

## What next?

To learn more about the **"what"** and **"why's"** of Prisma, the [Concepts](../../concepts) section has all the information needed to gain a deep understanding.

If you are looking for guidance and workflows the [Guides](../../guides) section has a plethora of content that covers subjects such as [Database guides](../../guides/database), [Testing](../../guides/testing), [Deployment](../../guides/deployment) and [Optimizations](../../guides/performance-and-optimization).


**Set up a new project from scratch**

The following guide explains how you can set up a new project from scratch using your own database as well as how to send queries with Prisma Client.

**Add Prisma to an existing npm project**

When adding Prisma to an already existing npm project, you can obtain your initial data model through [introspection](../concepts/components/introspection).
